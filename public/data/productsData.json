It has woodsy, spicy notes that balance the bright acidity and lively fruit tones of Central and South American varieties. Caribou Blend begins with a satisfying heaviness on your palate. Expect a big-bodied, syrupy taste with a clean, snappy finish of savory bittersweet chocolate. Caribou Blend is an inspired merging of sweet, spicy and berry notes for a smooth, relaxing, down-to-earth cup.\n \nFueling adventure since 1992. Coffee isn't just our business, it's our unrelenting passion. We love to roast it, brew it, smell it, and (duh!) drink it. But most of all, we love how it brings people together and inspires adventure, big and small."

This blend is specially roasted for cold coffee that stands up to ice, giving you a smooth, bold taste packed with the Dunkin’ flavor you crave.\nTo prepare, simply fill a tumbler or mug about ¾ of the way full with ice and brew a K-Cup® pod directly over it with your Keurig® coffee maker (glass not recommended when pouring hot coffee directly over ice). Stir for at least ten seconds and enjoy. Easy, convenient, and most importantly, delicious.\nIt's a success story that started in 1950 as a single donut shop in Quincy, Massachusetts, and now includes over 9,500 shops.

Sweet with a touch of spice.\n• Medium roast, caffeinated coffee\n• 100% Arabica coffee\n• Certified Orthodox Union Kosher\n \nThe secret of this blend's relaxed complexity is the rich, hearty Indonesian bean. It has woodsy, spicy notes that balance the bright acidity and lively fruit tones of Central and South American varieties. Caribou Blend begins with a satisfying heaviness on your palate. Expect a big-bodied, syrupy taste with a clean, snappy finish of savory bittersweet chocolate. Caribou Blend is an inspired merging of sweet, spicy and berry notes for a smooth, relaxing, down-to-earth cup.\n \nFueling adventure since 1992. Coffee isn't just our business, it's our unrelenting passion. We love to roast it, brew it, smell it, and (duh!) drink it. But most of all, we love how it brings people together and inspires adventure, big and small."

Expect a big-bodied, syrupy taste with a clean, snappy finish of savory bittersweet chocolate. Caribou Blend is an inspired merging of sweet, spicy and berry notes for a smooth, relaxing, down-to-earth cup.\n \nFueling adventure since 1992. Coffee isn't just our business, it's our unrelenting passion. We love to roast it, brew it, smell it, and (duh!) drink it. But most of all, we love how it brings people together and inspires adventure, big and small."

Sweet with a touch of spice.\n• Medium roast, caffeinated coffee\n• 100% Arabica coffee\n• Certified Orthodox Union Kosher\n \nThe secret of this blend's relaxed complexity is the rich, hearty Indonesian bean. It has woodsy, spicy notes that balance the bright acidity and lively fruit tones of Central and South American varieties. Caribou Blend begins with a satisfying heaviness on your palate. Expect a big-bodied, syrupy taste with a clean, snappy finish of savory bittersweet chocolate. Caribou Blend is an inspired merging of sweet, spicy and berry notes for a smooth, relaxing, down-to-earth cup.\n \nFueling adventure since 1992. Coffee isn't just our business, it's our unrelenting passion. We love to roast it, brew it, smell it, and (duh!) drink it. But most of all, we love how it brings people together and inspires adventure, big and small."

It has woodsy, spicy notes that balance the bright acidity and lively fruit tones of Central and South American varieties. Caribou Blend begins with a satisfying heaviness on your palate. Expect a big-bodied, syrupy taste with a clean, snappy finish of savory bittersweet chocolate. Caribou Blend is an inspired merging of sweet, spicy and berry notes for a smooth, relaxing, down-to-earth cup.\n \nFueling adventure since 1992. Coffee isn't just our business, it's our unrelenting passion. We love to roast it, brew it, smell it, and (duh!) drink it. But most of all, we love how it brings people together and inspires adventure, big and small."

It has woodsy, spicy notes that balance the bright acidity and lively fruit tones of Central and South American varieties. Caribou Blend begins with a satisfying heaviness on your palate. Expect a big-bodied, syrupy taste with a clean, snappy finish of savory bittersweet chocolate. Caribou Blend is an inspired merging of sweet, spicy and berry notes for a smooth, relaxing, down-to-earth cup.\n \nFueling adventure since 1992. Coffee isn't just our business, it's our unrelenting passion. We love to roast it, brew it, smell it, and (duh!) drink it. But most of all, we love how it brings people together and inspires adventure, big and small."

It has woodsy, spicy notes that balance the bright acidity and lively fruit tones of Central and South American varieties. Caribou Blend begins with a satisfying heaviness on your palate. Expect a big-bodied, syrupy taste with a clean, snappy finish of savory bittersweet chocolate. Caribou Blend is an inspired merging of sweet, spicy and berry notes for a smooth, relaxing, down-to-earth cup.\n \nFueling adventure since 1992. Coffee isn't just our business, it's our unrelenting passion. We love to roast it, brew it, smell it, and (duh!) drink it. But most of all, we love how it brings people together and inspires adventure, big and small."
