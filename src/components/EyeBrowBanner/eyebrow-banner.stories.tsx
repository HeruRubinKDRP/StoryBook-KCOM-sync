Offer is only valid with 12-month purchase commitment of 16 boxes of 20/22/24CT or 16 bags of coffee, delivered over 4 orders with a minimum of 4 boxes/bags per order, through SMART Auto-Delivery or converted Scheduled Auto-Delivery. If 12-month commitment is not satisfied, Keurig® will charge you the balance of the list price of the coffee maker. Enrolled Pods are varieties of pods that have been added to your Auto-Delivery account either (1) at the time of purchase of your brewer or (2) through a subsequent Auto-Delivery order. Only Auto-Delivery Enrolled Pods count towards your 16-box commitment. Enrolled Pods ordered through Auto-Delivery are 25% off the list price. SMART Delivery requires your SMART Coffee Maker to be connected to Wi-Fi so that Keurig can track the consumption of Enrolled Pods. By signing up for SMART Delivery, you agree to (1) let Keurig.com observe brewer consumption patterns, (2) automatically replenish your supply of an Enrolled Pod when the inventory is running low as determined by Keurig and (3) charge your preferred method of payment saved in your account. Each variety of Enrolled Pods may have a different consumption pattern and may be on a different delivery schedule. The quantity of Enrolled Pods shipped is based on your average daily consumption and may be greater or fewer than your initial order. You can also adjust the number of pods you have at home manually in My Account or by calling Consumer Care. You will receive notice before any shipment and you may adjust or cancel your order until 11:59 PM EST on the day before your order is scheduled to ship by logging into your Keurig Account or by calling Customer Care. Connecting your SMART Coffee Maker to Wi-Fi is required for Keurig to track the consumption of Enrolled Pods. If you have not connected your SMART Coffee Maker within 60 days of purchase and brewed an initial pod while connected, Keurig® will automatically convert your SMART Delivery enrollment to a Scheduled Auto-Delivery enrollment. A Scheduled Auto-Delivery will send your initial order of Enrolled Pods every 6 weeks to help you reach your 16-box commitment. You will receive notice before any shipment and you may adjust or cancel your order until 11:59 PM EST on the day before your order is scheduled to ship by logging into your Keurig Account or by calling Customer Care. Additionally, you may convert back to SMART Delivery by connecting your brewer to Wi-Fi and reenrolling in SMART Delivery. You may cancel SMART Delivery or Scheduled Auto-Delivery at any time, free of charge through your online Keurig account or by calling Consumer Care at 866-901-2739. If you purchased your SMART Coffee Maker through the Keurig® Starter Kit program and have not fulfilled the 12-month, 16 box commitment before cancelling your SMART or Scheduled Auto-Delivery, you will be charged the remaining 50% of the list price of the coffee maker.
